Use this skill when the user is managing planned delivery work: writing a PRD, turning a PRD into an epic, breaking an epic into tasks, syncing that work to GitHub, starting implementation for a tracked issue, or asking for delivery status such as standups, blockers, or next work. Do not use for debugging code, writing tests, reviewing PRs, or standalone GitHub issue/PR operations without PRD, epic, task, or delivery-tracking context."

# CCPM - Claude Code Project Manager

A spec-driven development workflow: PRD → Epic → GitHub Issues → Parallel Agents → Shipped Code.

## Core Philosophy

Requirements live in files, not heads. Every feature starts as a PRD, becomes a technical epic, decomposes into GitHub issues, and gets executed by parallel agents with full traceability.

## File Conventions

Before doing anything, read `references/conventions.md` for path standards, frontmatter schemas, and GitHub operation rules. These apply to all phases.

## The Five Phases

### 1. Plan — Capture requirements
**When**: User wants to define a new feature, product requirement, or scope of work.
**Read**: `references/plan.md`
**Covers**: Writing PRDs through guided brainstorming, converting PRDs to technical epics.

### 2. Structure — Break it down
**When**: An epic exists and needs to be decomposed into concrete tasks.
**Read**: `references/structure.md`
**Covers**: Epic decomposition into numbered task files with dependencies and parallelization.

### 3. Sync — Push to GitHub
**When**: Local epic/tasks need to become GitHub issues, progress needs to be posted as comments, or a bug is found and needs a linked issue created.
**Read**: `references/sync.md`
**Covers**: Epic sync (epic + tasks → GitHub issues), issue sync (progress comments), closing issues/epics, bug reporting against completed issues.

### 4. Execute — Start building
**When**: User wants to start working on one or more GitHub issues with parallel agents.
**Read**: `references/execute.md`
**Covers**: Issue analysis (parallel work stream identification), launching parallel agents, coordinating worktrees.

### 5. Track — Know where things stand
**When**: User asks for status, standup report, what's blocked, what's next, or needs to validate state.
**Read**: `references/track.md`
**Covers**: Status, standup, search, in-progress, next priority, blocked items, validation.

## Script-First Rule

For deterministic operations — anything that reads and reports without needing reasoning — always run the bash script directly rather than doing the work manually:

| What the user wants | Script to run |
|---|---|
| Project status | `bash references/scripts/status.sh` |
| Standup report | `bash references/scripts/standup.sh` |
| List all epics | `bash references/scripts/epic-list.sh` |
| Show epic details | `bash references/scripts/epic-show.sh <name>` |
| Epic status | `bash references/scripts/epic-status.sh <name>` |
| List PRDs | `bash references/scripts/prd-list.sh` |
| PRD status | `bash references/scripts/prd-status.sh` |
| Search issues/tasks | `bash references/scripts/search.sh <query>` |
| What's in progress | `bash references/scripts/in-progress.sh` |
| What's next | `bash references/scripts/next.sh` |
| What's blocked | `bash references/scripts/blocked.sh` |
| Validate project state | `bash references/scripts/validate.sh` |

Use the LLM for work that requires reasoning: writing PRDs, analyzing parallelism, launching agents, synthesizing updates.

## Quick Reference

```
Plan a feature:     "I want to build X" or "create a PRD for X"
Parse to epic:      "turn the X PRD into an epic"
Decompose:          "break down the X epic into tasks"
Sync to GitHub:     "push the X epic to GitHub"
Start an issue:     "start working on issue 42"
Check status:       "what's our status" / "standup"
What's next:        "what should I work on next"
Merge epic:         "merge the X epic"
Report a bug:       "found a bug in issue 42" / "testing issue 42 revealed X"
```
